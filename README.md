#SnackFS

SnackFS is our bite-sized, lightweight HDFS compatible FileSystem built over Cassandra. With it's fat driver design

##Prerequisites

1. SBT : It can be set up from the instructions [here](http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Getting-Started/Setup.html#installing-sbt).

2. Cassandra(v1.2.12) : Instructions can be found [here](http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/GettingStarted). An easier alternative would be using [this project](https://github.com/pcmanus/ccm)

##Using SnackFS

###Use the binary

* You can download the SnackFS distribution from here -

* To add SnackFS to your SBT project use,

* To add SnackFS to your Maven project use,


###Build from Source

1. Checkout the source from http://github.com/tuplejump/snackfs or the_grand_central branch in http://githube.com/tuplejump/calliope

2. To build SnackFS distribution run sbt's dist command i nthe project directory

        [snackfs]$ sbt dist

   This will result in a "snackfs-{version}.zip" file in the "target" directory of "snackfs".
   Extract "snackfs-{version}.zip" at desired location and grant user permissions
   to read, write and execute the script "snackfs" located in bin directory

3. Start Cassandra (default setup for snackfs assumes its a cluster with 3 nodes)

4. It is possible to configure the file system by updating core-site.xml.
   The following properties can be added.
   * snackfs.cassandra.host (default 127.0.0.1)
   * snackfs.cassandra.port (default 9160)
   * snackfs.consistencyLevel.write (default QUORUM)
   * snackfs.consistencyLevel.read (default QUORUM)
   * snackfs.keyspace (default snackfs)
   * snackfs.subblock.size (default 8 MB (8 * 1024 * 1024))
   * snackfs.block.size (default 128 MB (128 * 1024 * 1024))
   * snackfs.replicationFactor (default 3)
   * snackfs.replicationStrategy (default org.apache.cassandra.locator.SimpleStrategy)

5. SnackFS Shell provides the fs commands similar to Hadoop Shell. For example to create a directory,

        [Snackfs(extracted)]$bin/snackfs -mkdir snackfs:///random

###To build and use with Hadoop

1. Setup Apache Hadoop v1.0.4.(http://hadoop.apache.org/#Getting+Started).
   The base directory will be referred as 'hadoop-1.0.4' in the following steps.

2. Execute the following commands in the snackfs project directory.

        [snackfs]$ sbt package

   This will result in a "snackfs_2.9.3-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar" file in the "target/scala-2.9.3" directory of "snackfs".
   Copy the jar to 'hadoop-1.0.4/lib'.

3. Copy all the jars in snackfs/lib_managed and scala-library-2.9.3.jar
   (located at '~/.ivy2/cache/org.scala-lang/scala-library/jars') to 'hadoop-1.0.4/lib'.

4. Copy snackfs/src/main/resources/core-site.xml to 'hadoop-1.0.4/conf'

5. Start Cassandra (default setup for snackfs assumes its a cluster with 3 nodes)

6. Hadoop fs commands can now be run using snackfs. For example,

        [hadoop-1.0.4]$ bin/hadoop fs -mkdir snackfs:///random


###To configure logging,
If you want your logs in a File, update LogConfiguration.config like below

    val config = new LoggerFactory("", Option(Level.ALL), List(FileHandler("logs")), true)

The arguments for LoggerFactory are

1. node - Name of the logging node. ("") is the top-level logger.
2. level - Log level for this node. Leaving it None implies the parent logger's level.
3. handlers - Where to send log messages.
4. useParents - indicates if log messages are passed up to parent nodes.To stop at this node level, set it to false

Additional logging configuration details can be found [here](https://github.com/twitter/util/tree/master/util-logging#configuring)
